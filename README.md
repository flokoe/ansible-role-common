A role which installs and configures most basic things I always need.

**Mostly for my personal use, so be careful if you want to use it too!**

```bash
ansible-galaxy install flokoe.common
```

Using `requirements.yml`:

```yaml

```

## Testing

If you add new functionality, make sure to write appropriate tests as well.

To install all required test dependencies in a local development environment you can execute the following:

python3 -m venv env

source env/bin/activate

pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

Run all tests:
